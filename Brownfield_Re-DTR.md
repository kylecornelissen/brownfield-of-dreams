### Brownfield of Dreams DTR

**Project:** Brownfield of Dreams

**Group Member Names:** Kyle Cornelissen, Aurie Gochenour

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**

We want to complete all user stories and attempt extension work once those are done. 100% test coverage is expected.  We would all like to learn how to be more effective in a larger team.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**

Aurie prefers to work quickly and is good at explaining the results.  Kyle likes to keep a peaceful atmosphere, and considers himself to be a people person.

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**

Communication is going to be important. We are both on board to put in extra hours to overcome obstacles. We are willing to pair program problems initially then will look outside to find help if we are unable to resolve an issue on our own.

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):**

We are flexible programmers.  Aurie's preference is to set work goals over setting time blocks, and is also partial to working into the evening.  Kyle has a dog and cannot be here past 9:00p and has a wedding on Saturday.

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):**

Standups before each day and at the end of each day. Slack will be the go-to for all non-essential communication.  Decisions will be reached organically as often as possible.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**

Kyle - JavaScript, working with dates in ruby/rails, staying on top of things  
Aurie - testing, project management, agile principles, making better pull requests

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**

We each want to get a good mix of everything, we're all here to learn.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**

We're using ConveyorBelt to manage workflow.  As far as the project board goes, the expectation is that whomever completes the work will move the card over.  Pull requests are to be reviewed/merged by someone other than the person that wrote the code.

No commits to the master branch.

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**

General format is specific, actionable, kind.

**Day 1 Agenda:**

- Deploy to Heroku
- Setup intial Rails app
- Setup migrations and schema
- Breakdown user stories into something more manageable
